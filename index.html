    <h2>A reminder</h2>
    <p>It is all too easy to feel that cooking is a burden, a distraction, and a chore.  For that reason I've chosen to put this quote at the top of my recipe website.  It serves as a reminder every time I pull it up to cook that I am about to partake in an ancient, life-sustaining ritual and to find joy in the mundane routines that life is full of.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"One of the very nicest things about life is the way we must regularly stop whatever it is we are doing and devote our attention to eating."</p>-Luciano Pavarotti</p>
