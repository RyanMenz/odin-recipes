# odin-recipes

The goal of this repository is to solidify the basics of html and css by applying them to a project.  I previously kept all my recipes in a google doc.  I've since become gluten-free and I can no longer eat most of the recipes that I used to cook.  I hope to update and improve upon the google doc system with this project and use it as my primary means of cooking reference.
